schema: spec-driven

# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform

  Vision: ProjectSpecs is a lightweight, AI-native project specification layer that turns enterprise requirements and architecture artifacts into structured, traceable project specs consumed by humans and AI assistants without copy/paste.
  Tech stack: Node.js (20+), TypeScript, CLI-first distribution.
  Conventions: Local-first canonical `projectspec/` folder as source of truth; profiles/workflows drive generation and pruning; stable IDs for REQ/ADR/INT/Change; read-only integrations in MVP with explicit write-back gating.
  Style guides: Human-readable Markdown/YAML/JSON artifacts; actions over phase gates; avoid over-prescriptive structure; keep artifacts concise and testable. All new code must be fully typed (no implicit any).
  Quality gates: Every new feature must pass lint checks and unit tests.
  Documentation: Each new spec should result in user/developer-facing documentation for the outcome (e.g., CLI usage in package README). High-level design lives in docs/ and should not duplicate OpenSpec artifacts; focus on end-user and developer guidance.
  Domain knowledge: Enterprise delivery artifacts (requirements, ADRs, integration contracts, NFRs) mapped to traceability; integrations with Jira/Confluence/GitHub Projects; drift detection between requirements and work items.
  Testability and maintainability: Test coverage must be >=80% for all code

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
rules:
  proposal:
    - Include an explicit Non-Goals section
    - Keep proposals concise (under 1–2 pages)
    - List capability names in kebab-case
  design:
    - Include Decisions with alternatives considered
    - Include Risks with mitigations
    - Focus on architecture, not line-by-line implementation
  specs:
    - Every requirement has at least one scenario
    - Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements
    - Scenarios use #### headers with WHEN/THEN
    - Prefer ADDED unless behavior changes require MODIFIED
  tasks:
    - Each task should be achievable in one session
    - Order tasks by dependency
    - Include at least one verification task per task group
    - When possible tasks should be able to be tested automatically and autonomously
